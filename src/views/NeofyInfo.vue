        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I'm a 25-year-old freelance artist driven by a lifelong passion for visual storytelling.</p>
        <p>My creative journey reaches between 2D illustration and concept art, as well as 3D modeling and animation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I thrive on bringing imaginative concepts to life through vibrant visuals and dynamic motion.</p>
        <p>
            I'm currently immersed in the exciting process of creating my own short animated film using Blender,
            a project that allows me to fully explore my skills and vision.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My experience also includes character modeling and animation for the Steam game 'Banana Drama',
            where I contributed to crafting engaging and memorable characters.
        </p>
        <p>While I've always been drawn to art, the past few years have seen it evolve from a hobby to my central focus.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm eager to collaborate on diverse projects, offering my skills for contracts and commissions.</p>
        <p>I'm particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to contribute my unique style and technical abilities to bring creative visions to life.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to connect and explore how my artistic skills can serve your project.</p>

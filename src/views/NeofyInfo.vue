        Hello! I'm a 25-year-old freelance artist driven by a lifelong passion for visual storytelling.
        My creative journey spans 2D illustration and concept art, as well as 3D modeling and animation.
        I thrive on bringing imaginative concepts to life through vibrant visuals and dynamic motion.
        I'm currently immersed in the exciting process of creating my own short animated film using Blender,
        a project that allows me to fully explore my skills and vision.
        My experience also includes character modeling and animation for the Steam game 'Banana Drama',
        where I contributed to crafting engaging and memorable characters.
        While I've always been drawn to art, the past few years have seen it evolve from a hobby to my central focus.
        I'm eager to collaborate on diverse projects, offering my skills for contracts and commissions.
        I'm particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to contribute my unique style and technical abilities to bring creative visions to fruition.
        I'm excited to connect and explore how my artistic skills can serve your 
        project.

        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>I’m a young 3D Artist.</p>
        <p>I’m someone who is generally interested in how things look, feel and function.
            I am focused on design in many or almost all aspects of life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When it comes to animation I am amazed how inspiring it can make one feel.
            How it can bring up emotions and tell stories with deep meanings.</p>
            <br>
        <p>
            At the moment, I’m working on my own short animated project in Blender,
            which gives me the possibility to explore my creativity, ideas, and character-driven storytelling.
            In the past, I’ve also worked on the Steam game Banana Drama, including modeling and animation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Over time, art has changed from what i just did in class or at home experimenting to a full passion.
            I work very organized with a focus on detail and a clean look.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am always open for new contacts, just write me an Email.</p>
